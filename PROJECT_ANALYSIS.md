### Distribution Workflow Analysis

#### 1. Draft Stage (Initial Creation)

**Triggered by**: `POST /api/distributions`
**Fields Updated**:

```php
'status' => 'draft'
'created_by' => Auth::id()
'distribution_number' => 'YY/LOCATION/TYPE/SEQUENCE'
'created_at' => now()
```

**Document Operations**:

- Validates document location matches user's department location
- Auto-includes related documents (additional docs attached to invoices)
- Creates entries in `distribution_documents` table
  **History Entry**: 'created' action logged

#### 2. Sender Verification Stage

**Triggered by**: `POST /api/distributions/{id}/verify-sender`
**Fields Updated**:

```php
'status' => 'verified_by_sender'
'sender_verified_at' => now()
'sender_verified_by' => Auth::id()
'sender_verification_notes' => $verificationNotes
```

**Document-Level Updates**:

```php
// For each document in document_verifications array:
'sender_verified' => true
'sender_verification_status' => 'verified' | 'missing' | 'damaged'
'sender_verification_notes' => $notes_per_document
```

**Business Rules**:

- Only allowed if status is 'draft'
- Each document can be marked as verified, missing, or damaged
- Individual verification notes per document
  **History Entry**: 'verified_by_sender' action logged

#### 3. Send Stage

**Triggered by**: `POST /api/distributions/{id}/send`
**Fields Updated**:

```php
'status' => 'sent'
'sent_at' => now()
```

**Business Rules**:

- Only allowed if status is 'verified_by_sender'
- No document modifications allowed
- Triggers notification to destination department
  **History Entry**: 'sent' action logged

#### 4. Receive Stage

**Triggered by**: `POST /api/distributions/{id}/receive`
**Fields Updated**:

```php
'status' => 'received'
'received_at' => now()
```

**Critical Document Location Updates**:

```php
// Updates cur_loc field for distributed documents
Invoice::where('id', $invoiceId)->update(['cur_loc' => $destinationLocationCode]);
AdditionalDocument::where('id', $docId)->update(['cur_loc' => $destinationLocationCode]);
```

**Business Rules**:

- Only allowed if status is 'sent'
- **KEY FEATURE**: Automatically updates document locations to destination department
- This is the core business logic - documents physically "move" between departments
  **History Entry**: 'received' action with location change details

#### 5. Receiver Verification Stage

**Triggered by**: `POST /api/distributions/{id}/verify-receiver`
**Fields Updated**:

```php
'status' => 'verified_by_receiver'
'receiver_verified_at' => now()
'receiver_verified_by' => Auth::id()
'receiver_verification_notes' => $verificationNotes
'has_discrepancies' => $hasDiscrepancies
```

**Document-Level Updates**:

```php
// For each document in document_verifications array:
'receiver_verified' => true
'receiver_verification_status' => 'verified' | 'missing' | 'damaged'
'receiver_verification_notes' => $notes_per_document
```

**Discrepancy Handling**:

- If any document marked as 'missing' or 'damaged', requires confirmation
- `force_complete_with_discrepancies` parameter can override
- Creates detailed discrepancy notifications
- Separate history entries for each discrepancy
  **Business Rules**:
- Only allowed if status is 'received'
- Comprehensive verification with discrepancy management
  **History Entry**: 'verified_by_receiver' action + individual discrepancy entries

#### 6. Completion Stage

**Triggered by**: `POST /api/distributions/{id}/complete`
**Fields Updated**:

```php
'status' => 'completed'
```

**Business Rules**:

- Only allowed if status is 'verified_by_receiver'
- Final stage - no further modifications allowed
- Triggers completion notifications
  **History Entry**: 'completed' action logged
